# ArenaSimulationProject
The aim of the project is to measure the efficiency of modeling department of FLO and to create a decision support system in which better solutions can be proposed. For this purpose; work, employee and production information were compiled; the average time spent in each station was determined, a simulation model was prepared using Arena Software and the current system was prepared. After that, the actual data was entered to observe how different scenarios were concluded. These scenarios were created by changing the number of employees per department, the total working hours and the validation time of the models for the coloring phase. If desired, the user can create his own scenarios by changing the variables and observe their effect on production.
